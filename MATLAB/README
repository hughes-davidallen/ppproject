****README SECTION FOR MATLAB VISUALIZATION****

**How to run**

Navigate to the MATLAB directory in the project submission.  It is at ./MATLAB.

from this directory, open matlab and the script ThermalVector.m.

This will run our visualization on the output generated by our x10 code.  It
will load the file, and display 2 slices through our 3D object.  Be sure to 
select the 'Rotate 3D' button from the toolbar and drag the display around.

Our sample displays the results of a hot cylinder placed in a cold area for
a number of time steps.

This matlab script provides a good and easy way to implement sanity check on
whether or not our x10 code is behaving as expected.

**Files Included**

ThermalVector.m

	- This file is a relatively simple matlab script which imports the results
	  of our x10 simluation and displays it in an interactive way to the end
	  user
	  
	***Be sure to change the file path and file name in the first line of that .m file

cyl.m

	- This is a matlab script we use to generate an arbitrary-sized input for
	  our x10 code.  It generates a simple 'hot' square 'cylinder' in an 
	  otherwise cold environment.
